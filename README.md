As part of the process for a position at a digital marketing agency, they gave me the website of an airline to work on. The task was to create a program that would check the flights that the user had previously searched for, and show the last 3 on the website next time it loaded. The main condition was that the code had to work from the console, like it was injected.
I found out that the airline website used localStorage to save previously searched flights, and design-wise, the results had to blend with the rest of the website. I managed to make it work, but the main issue with my code was that it was not scalable. And due to lack of knowledge, I had to hard-code some values also. I didn't get the job, of course, but I was still proud of what I had achieved.
