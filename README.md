# Flight search (Interview test, volume 1)

## Context
The first installment in my series of interview test. As part of the process for a role at a digital marketing agency, they gave me the website of an airline to work on. The task was to create a program that would check the flights that the user had previously searched for, and display the last 3 the next time it loaded. The main condition was that the code had to work from the console, like it was injected. This assignment relied on another website, so I decided to replicate it as a way to practice, and to improve my initial solution. 

## Tech stack
HTML, CSS (SASS), TypeScript.

## Requirements
- The assignment was meant to be completed with JavaScript, and it had to work by being run from the browser's console.
- The design should fit in with the rest of the website.

## Process 
First, I had to dig around the website's code to understand its structure. I found out that the website had two forms, one for desktop and another for mobile, and only the mobile form was the one that actually processed the form. I also discovered that it used localStorage to save previously searched flights. Being a detective can be fun. Design-wise, I made the results blend with the rest of the website, which looked nice and was appreciated. 

## Problems
Due to my lack of knowledge at that particular time, I had to hard-code some values and overall my code was not scalable. It still worked though! hehe.

## Learnings
I'd say I'm much more conscious about making my code scalable by learning and applying best practices. I also don't hard-code values anymore, as far as I know. I didn't get the job, but I was still proud of what I had achieved. Now that my skills have improved, I look at this assignment fondly.
